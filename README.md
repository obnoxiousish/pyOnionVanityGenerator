# pyOnionVanityGenerator
A python TUI &amp; GUI using pysha3 and pynacl to generate tor vanity onions

on a 16/32 intel xeon cpu with 2-3.6ghz it does around 12-15M onions per minute, i think mkp224o does that in a few seconds or so, so i guess it sucks, not sure if the priv/pub key format is correct tbh didnt bother testing it
